# This project uses Pyodide to run Python in the browser.
# The Python dependencies are not managed through a standard requirements.txt file.
# Instead, they are part of the Pyodide environment bundled with the project.
# This file is for documentation purposes.

# Core Pyodide modules used in main.py:
# - pyodide.ffi
# - pyodide.http

# The `runtime` directory contains the Pyodide distribution and bundled packages.

# The Pyodide files are managed by the scripts in the runtime directory.
# Specifically, runtime/setup.sh and runtime/setup.py contain the logic to download the necessary files from the Pyodide CDN.
# To re-download or update these files, you can run the setup.sh script: bash runtime/setup.sh
